The FIST program prints posters consisting of a clenched
fist with slogans in block letters below.  This program
traces its lineage directly back to a UNIVAC mainframe
program written in September 1969 by the author when such
banners were rather more in demand than at present.

For information on how to build and install the program, see
the INSTALL file.  Source code for this program is written in
the CWEB "Literate Programming" language in which C source code
and TeX internal documentation are maintained in a the *.w
files. CWEB programming tools may be downloaded from:

    http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html

but you do *not* need to install the CWEB tools to build this
program; a ready-to-compile C program is included.  An annotated
source code listing is provided in the file fist.pdf, which may
be read with Acrobat Reader, which is a free download from:

    http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html
