.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fist

.B \-n
.BI \-s factor
.B \-u
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fist
prints an image of a clenched fist (unless suppressed by the
.B \-c
option), followed by a slogan in block letters, limited to
16 characters per line (``Television is to news as bumper
stickers are to philosophy.''\-Richard M. Nixon).  Options
permit you to scale the fist commensurate to the iniquities of
the Oppressor (or your printer's paper size, whichever
is smaller), select right- or left-handed blows
against the Empire, and various other gimmicks which popped into
the mind of this Humble Programmer while watching "Ice Station
Zebra" over and over again and watching his fingernails grow.
Oops...that was another megalomaniac.
Anyway, here's the latest
incarnation of the
.B fist
program.  May your banners ever
espouse worthy causes, and may those truly worthy be achieved.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-c
Chill out: no fist is generated, only the message text.
.TP
.BI \-f pat
Fill the fist with the text pattern
.IR pat ,
which may be any string of ASCII/ISO characters.  If the
pattern contains blanks or characters interpreted by the
shell, it should be quoted or escaped appropriately.
.TP
.B \-l
The fist will be left handed.
.TP
.BI \-m text
Supply a line of the text to be printed below the fist on the
command line.  If the text contains blank or shell metacharacters
it should be quoted or escaped.  Only the first 16 characters of the
.I text
will be printed.  You may supply multiple
.B \-m
options for multi-line text.  Note that you must also specify
the
.B \-n
option if you don't want
.B fist
to read additional lines of text from standard input
after printing lines supplied by the
.B \-m
option.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not read text to be printed below the fist from standard input.
Unless you've specified text with one or more
.B \-m
options, no text at all will be printed, just the fist.
If you specify only the
.B \-c
and
.B \-n
options, the only consequence of running
.B fist
will be the passage of time.
.TP
.BI \-s factor
Scale the fist by the given percentage
.I factor
between 25 and 100.
.TP
.B \-u
Print how to call information.
.SH FILES
Lines of text (limited to 16 characters) are read from standard input
unless suppressed by the
.B \-n
option; these lines are printed in block letters below the fist.
Input from standard input is terminated by an end of file.  Output
is written to standard output.  Input and output are processed
strictly sequentially and hence
.B fist
may be used in pipelines.
.SH BUGS
The block character font is a limited subset of ASCII containing only
upper case letters, numbers, and punctuation with character codes
between hexadecimal 20 and 5F.  The font was originally created in the
late 1960's in UNIVAC 1108 six bit FIELDATA code, and re-shuffled
into ASCII order when the first port was made to an ASCII machine
in 1981.  If you'd like to add lower case letters, ISO codes, or
full Unicode, go right ahead.
.PP
.B fist
will not work on machines which do not use the ASCII character code
(for example EBCDIC machines).  You'll need to shuffle the font
table or translate character codes to ASCII before you index it.
I don't have such a machine, so I'm not going to include
code I can't test.
.PP
Scale factors smaller than about 60 on the
.B \-s
option produce infelicitous results: the fist looks like
it's wearing a mitten.
.PP
You can't aggregate options, separate options from their arguments
with a blank, or other cool
.B getopt
features because the program doesn't use
.B getopt
in order to preserve its retro look.
.PP
Over the last thirty years numerous people have suggested the
program might be enhanced by adding options to raise two
fingers (``peace'') or only one finger (well, you know). 
Please send me the code if you make this decades-long dream
a reality.
